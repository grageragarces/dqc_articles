1) early stages I mean the first landmark paper is from 2018 (pablo and chris)

we jsut got the claim to the first distributed quantum computer - although it is no publicly accessible
this is xanadus aurora - but in a way any photonic quantum computer is distributed by definition 
distribution in a sense comes "for free" in that architecture because Ur computing with photons that are moving around anyways
and the qubits that are sent through networks in long distance settings are photons.
you can technically actually manually move atoms or ions from one table to another by pinching them but from my understand this is not scalable, so quantum network = flying qubits = photons

we had the claim of the first distributed algorithm by oxford this year
was it really an algorithm or even a protocol? well not really they did teleportation
it was really not associated to computation done at either side so like it kinda wasn't a distributed algorithm but no matter

“In just seven years, the field went from theoretical sketches to experimental claims of distribution — though we’re still far from practical DQC.

there are currently no testbeds we can work with either 
so what are dqc people doing and whats probably going to go wrong 

difference between communication-level distribution and computational distribution — i.e., sending qubits vs distributing computation.
That distinction helps readers understand why teleportation ≠ DQC yet.
</p>

<p> 
2) a bit part of the dqc discourse is the partitioning of computations for distribution
this is something that hpc people through about way back when to
like they reached back in the day and we're slowly coming to see its quite a hard problem to solve
as things scale you can't be cutting up 1 million qubit computations 
Ur gonna need a hpc just to manage your quantum computer!
This is also a problem that arises in compilation optimizations, 
walking through the landscape of possible optimizations for a semi reasonable quantum computatio is incredibly computationally demanding.
but either way its a bit of a collide with proposing a solution to scalability
</p>

<p> 
3) what people can do is distribute quantum comp and then recomp the solution with classical channels
qiskits addon library does this quite nicely
you basically run the computation fully sequentially and use the output of many shots of one side as the inputs to the second 
this emulates a quantum channel
but it break entanglement, meaning its not as accurate
and more importantly its exponentially costly
also it just doesn't in any way represent the real noise that will arise in these networks that we need to deal with.
more on this later.
but! despite all of this it does mean we can try out distributed quantum algorithms
and a few examples have staters appearing (citq??)
there is also a proposal to emulate a quantum channel within a device by basically channing many cnot jumps between to subcomputations that are as possibly physically separated as possible within a chip
</p>

<p> 
4) errors errors erros... over the past few months these have been dizziying me
you see networks 
1) don't present the same error profiles as quantum computers
2) they inject about an order of magnitude higher final loses into the final fidelity based on current simulations
3) the effect they inject depends on the communication primitive you perform

not to mention that in dqc we're often talking about having different kinds of computers collaborating with each other
this leads to heterogeneous noise profiles
and perhaps even local (baked in) corrections occuring in some devices but not in others 

for communication primitives U have two options tp and cat
tp = teleportation, you can think of it as wire cutting 
the technique under hardware contraints for capacity here is swapping! 
cat is different it is gate cuttting and works this way

*will inser image here*
</p>

<p> 
5) so what simulators are out There:
    1) a classiq is netsquid by tu deltf
    good / bad
    2) sequence is its' open source counterpart
    3) recently cisco has laid claim to its network-aware distributed quantum compiler
    4) qiskit addon has ..
</p>

<p> 
Conclusion?
