    <h1>Why am I working on Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC)?</h1>
    <p><em>May 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) offers a promising path to scale quantum capabilities beyond the limitations of single devices.
      In this post, I share the motivation behind my work in this area:
      why distributing quantum computations matters, what challenges it poses,
      and how it connects to real limitations in current hardware.
      This sets the stage for a broader discussion on how we can externalize,
      coordinate, and benchmark quantum computation across multiple devices.
