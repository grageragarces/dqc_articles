    <strong>Graph:</strong> A mathematical structure consisting of <em>nodes</em> (vertices) and <em>edges</em> that connect pairs of nodes. 
    Each edge links <em>two</em> nodes together.
  <br>
    <strong>Hypergraph:</strong> A generalization of a graph where edges (called <em>hyperedges</em>) 
    can connect any number of nodes, <em>not</em> just two. 
    A hyperedge can link two, three, four, or more nodes simultaneously.
    You can think of a hypergraph as a collection of groups, where each hyperedge defines one group of interconnected nodes.

Hypergraphs are a mathematical structure that allow us to encode relationships between different entities.
In distributed quantum computing, they are used to encode the relationships between qubits, such that when these are assigned to different quantum processors, 
if they hold some connection between them (let's say through a CX gate in the computation), 
this connection is respected accross the devices through whichever links connect the QPUs.
Meaning that if we allot groups of qubits needed for a distributed computation to two interconnected QPUs, 
a hypergraph abstraction of this computation allows us to see which hyperedges separate both groups, 
and thus signify the need for non-local operations (such as a teleportation or cat-entagler).

This way of modeling distributed quantum computations has intertwined hypergraph theory with the field of DQC.
In this blog post I will dive into hypergraph partitioning heuristics designed to tackle the hypergraph partitioning problem, 
which is a very well known NP-hard problem in computer science, but may not be the best fit for DQC.

  <h2>Hypergraphs in DQC</h2>
how did it come into the discourse - papers

<section> 
  <h2>Hypergraph partitioning: the problem</h2>
what the hypergraph problem is, how its not quite DQC but a starting point for the field, and how its hard
</section>

<section> 
  <h2>Hypergraph partitioning in DQC today</h2>
alternatives (graphs, himanshu work, hungarian): but hypergraphs are the most flexible

my own work with HDHs into model agnosticity

<section> 
    <h2>Hypergraph partitioning beyond DQC</h2>
despite what I may lead you to believe hypergraph partitioning is much bigger than dqc
examples alt applications
</section>

<section> 
  <h2>Heuristics</h2>
but as I said before the problem in NP-hard -> heuristic

    <div style="background-color:#fff8dc; border-left:4px solid #e6d87c; padding:10px 15px; margin:10px 0;">
  <strong>Heuristic:</strong> DEF

let's talk about them and limitations
