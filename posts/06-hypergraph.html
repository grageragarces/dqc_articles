  <h2>Hypergraphs in DQC</h2>
how did it come into the discourse
</section>

<section> 
  <h2>Hypergraph partitioning: the problem</h2>
what the hypergraph problem is, how its not quite DQC but a starting point for the field, and how its hard
</section>

<section> 
  <h2>Hypergraph partitioning in DQC today</h2>
alternatives (graphs, himanshu work, hungarian): but hypergraphs are the most flexible

<br>

my own work with HDHs into model agnosticity
</section>

<section> 
    <h2>Hypergraph partitioning beyond DQC</h2>
despite what I may lead you to believe hypergraph partitioning is much bigger than dqc
examples alt applications
</section>

<section> 
  <h2>Heuristics</h2>
but as I said before the problem in NP-hard -> heuristic

    <div style="background-color:#fff8dc; border-left:4px solid #e6d87c; padding:10px 15px; margin:10px 0;">
  <strong>Heuristic:</strong> DEF

    </div>
  
let's talk about them and limitations
