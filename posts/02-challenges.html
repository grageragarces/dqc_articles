<p>
    Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) is emerging as a necessary strategy to overcome physical limits in scaling up quantum devices. 
    Instead of building ever-larger monolithic machines, we explore architectures composed of smaller quantum processors connected by quantum or classical links. 
    But distributing quantum computations introduces deep challenges—physical, architectural, and algorithmic—that go beyond classical distributed systems.
</p>

<p>
    At the heart of DQC lies a fundamental question: how do we enable coherent computation across separate quantum processing units? 
    Unlike classical systems, quantum mechanics imposes strict constraints: no-cloning, entanglement fragility, and measurement collapse. 
    The challenge isn’t just technical—it’s conceptual. What does a “distributed” quantum computation mean when information can’t be freely copied or buffered?
</p>

<p>
    One major challenge is dealing with errors at scale. 
    Should we encode the entire distributed system using a global quantum error correction code like qLDPC, 
    or use a modular approach such as local surface code patches stitched together via teleportation or lattice surgery? 
    The trade-off between global encoding efficiency and local modularity affects fault tolerance, control complexity, and hardware feasibility.
</p>

<p>
    Another challenge is network composability. 
    Swapping a quantum link for a classical one (e.g., via measurement and feedforward) has intrinsic costs: latency, decoherence, and potential fidelity loss. 
    Understanding the operational cost of hybrid links—and their impact on algorithm runtime and reliability—is essential. Can we still compose systems in a modular way without breaking the quantum advantages?
</p>

<p>
    Architectural parallelism raises the question: can distributed quantum systems offer speedups through physical parallelism alone, regardless of the algorithm used? 
    In classical systems, architecture-driven parallelism has enabled huge gains. Will quantum networks offer similar benefits, 
    or must quantum algorithms be explicitly restructured to exploit network-imposed parallelism?
</p>

<p>
    All these challenges converge in the design of quantum algorithms. 
    Some workloads are inherently centralised and resist partitioning. 
    Others may be reformulated to match distributed constraints, trading depth for width or qubits for communication. 
    What makes an algorithm “distributable” at scale? 
    Designing or compiling quantum workloads to exploit locality and tolerate inter-device noise is still an open question.
</p>

<p>
    In future posts, I’ll delve into methods to analyse and rewrite quantum circuits for distribution. 
    I’ll also introduce tools like Hybrid Dependency Hypergraphs (HDHs), which help expose which parts of a computation are truly local, 
    which depend on network coordination, and where classical-quantum boundaries matter. 
    This is where DQC becomes not just a hardware problem, but a compiler and design problem too.
